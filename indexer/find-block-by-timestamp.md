Write a Rust service (or even script, whatever's easier for you) that takes in a timestamp and uses an RPC node to find the latest (i.e.: most recent / biggest block number) block (on Solana) that matches that timestamp or is right before that timestamp if no exact match exists. We assume the timestamp is valid (not in the future, not previous to Solana existing).

Try not to spend more than 4h on it, try to document things that you'd do if you had more time. You can probably get a free RPC from Helius, but ping me if it rate limits you and I'll give you a paid one. Lmk if you have any Qs.
